<h3>Precautions</h3>
<p>
As many of you may know LTT is taking a less than caring attitude to the IRC at this point.
We are being led to believe that they just don't care any more, and I fear that they may just come and shut it without warning, of course we are not going to let that happen.
At this point there is no real saftey from one of the admins walking into the IRC channel and forcefully closing it.</p>
<br />
<p>As you may know I've been pushing the admins for a move to <a href="http://freenode.net">Freenode</a>. With LTT not really careing about the IRC if at any point in the near future the IRC seems really threatened there is already a new channel on freenode set up by me that will be ran by us. This will turnt he channel completely unofficial, give us better access to decent resources (in the form of useful channels) on a well run network.
